# Mastering Active Directory
This is the code repository for [Mastering Active Directory](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-active-directory?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787289352), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Active Directory is a centralized and standardized system that automates networked management of user data, security, and distributed resources and enables interoperation with other directories. If you are aware of Active Directory basics and want to gain expertise in it, this book is perfect for you. 

We will quickly go through the architecture and fundamentals of Active Directory and then dive deep into the core components, such as forests, domains, sites, trust relationships, OU, objects, attributes, DNS, and replication. We will then move on to AD schemas, global catalogs, LDAP, RODC, RMS, certificate authorities, group policies, and security best practices, which will help you gain a better understanding of objects and components and how they can be used effectively. We will also cover AD Domain Services and Federation Services for Windows Server 2016 and all their new features. Last but not least, you will learn how to manage your identity infrastructure for a hybrid-cloud setup. All this will help you design, plan, deploy, manage operations on, and troubleshoot your enterprise identity infrastructure in a secure, effective manner. 

Furthermore, I will guide you on how to automate administrative tasks using PowerShell cmdlets. Toward the end, we will cover best practices and troubleshooting techniques that can be used to improve security and performance in an identity infrastructure.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter16.



The code will look like the following:
```
   xJeaEndPoint Demo3EP
   {
       Name = 'Demo3EP'
       ToolKit = 'FileSystem'
       Ensure = 'Present'
       DependsOn = '[xJeaToolKit]FileSystem'
   }
```
